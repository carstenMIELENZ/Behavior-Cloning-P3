    "\n",
    " This Section is not required to complete but acts as an additional excersise for understaning the output of a neural network's weights. While neural networks can be a great learning device they are often referred to as a black box. We can understand what the weights of a neural network look like better by plotting their feature maps. After successfully training your neural network you can see what it's feature maps look like by plotting the output of the network's weight layers in response to a test stimuli image. From these plotted feature maps, it's possible to see what characteristics of an image the network finds interesting. For a sign, maybe the inner network feature maps react with high activation to the sign's boundary outline or to the contrast in the sign's painted symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    " Provided for you below is the function code that allows you to get the visualization output of any tensorflow weight layer you want. The inputs to the function should be a stimuli image, one used during training or a new one you provided, and then the tensorflow variable name that represents the layer's state during the training process, for instance if you wanted to see what the [LeNet lab's](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/fbf77062-5703-404e-b60c-95b78b2f3f9e/modules/6df7ae49-c61c-4bb2-a23e-6527e69209ec/lessons/601ae704-1035-4287-8b11-e2c2716217ad/concepts/d4aca031-508f-4e0b-b493-e7b706120f81) feature maps looked like for it's second convolutional layer you could enter conv2 as the tf_activation variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an example of what feature map outputs look like, check out NVIDIA's results in their paper [End-to-End Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/) in the section Visualization of internal CNN State. NVIDIA was able to show that their network's inner weights had high activations to road boundary lines by comparing feature maps from an image with a clear path to one without. Try experimenting with a similar test to show that your trained network's weights are looking for interesting features, whether it's looking at differences in feature maps from images with or without a sign, or even what feature maps look like in a trained network vs a completely untrained one on the same sign image.\n",

    "##Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To drive the car autonomously in the Udacity simulator using behavioural cloning, I have performed the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Gathering Training Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulator Training Data\n",
    "The Udacity simulator has a recording option which saves a simulation run. The recorded data consists of colour images (resolution 160x302x3) over time from the centre, left and right camera of the car and a CVS file driving_log.cvs. The CVS file lists the steering angle, throttle and speed of the car for centre camera images.\n",
    "The figure below shows an extract of the CVS file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Training-set (code lines 13-55)\n",
    "The recorded data of simulation runs were used as training data for a convolutional neural (CNN) model. Input of the CNN model were the images from the simulator and output were the steering angle of the car (to predict). I used 3 different recorded data-sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) the Udacity provided data-set of track 1\n",
    "    2) a generated data-set of track 1, driving anti-clockwise and focusing on smooth turns (2 x laps)\n",
    "    3) a generated data-set of track 1, driving clock-wise (3 x laps)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Cameras (code lines 66-104)\n",
    "In order to increase the number data-points I used all 3 camera images. Since there is only one steering angle value for the centre camera image given and I calculated the steering angle value for the left and right camera image by adding 0.25 to the steering value for the left- and subtracting 0.25 of the steering value for the right camera. These steps did increase the training-set by factor 3. The figures below present the camera images of simulation run.\n",
    "\n",
    "![processed image 1](./Picture1.jpg \"Original\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Augmentation (code lines 111-132)\n",
    "Additionally, I augmented images to increase and normalize the training-set. I used the following approach: images were flipped horizontally and the according steering value was corrected by multiplying -1.0 to the original value. This augmentation was only used for “non-straight driving” images with an absolute steering value > 0.21 which resulted in a better normalization of the distribution of the training-set.\n",
    "\n",
    "![processed image 2](./Picture2.jpg \"Original\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "Optimization (code lines 43-55)\n",
    "Furthermore, I optimized the training-set by removing “straight driving” images of the centre camera by almost 90% from the original data-set (images read from the simulation runs). Rationale for this step was that the data-set did contain too much “straight driving” images which resulted in poor autonomous driving behaviour @ the simulator. With this images removal the model did drive through the track 1 successfully.\n"
